<#
.SYNOPSIS
    This script audits all virtual machines in the current Azure subscription to identify the publisher and SKU of the image used to create them.

.DESCRIPTION
    It retrieves a list of all VMs, then for each VM, it fetches detailed information to find the image reference publisher and SKU.
    This is useful for ensuring that all VMs are built from approved or expected image sources.

.OUTPUTS
    Outputs custom PowerShell objects containing the VM Name, Resource Group, Image Publisher, and Image SKU.
    If image details cannot be determined (e.g., for custom images), they will be noted as 'Custom Image' or 'Unknown'.
